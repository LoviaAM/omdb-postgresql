<h2>About omdb</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.omdb.org/content/About">omdb</a> (open media database) is a
free database for film media. There is no set editorial staff, but rather a
large number of movie addicts and lovers who volunteer their time to provide
material and develop the site. Anybody can add or change existing information
on omdb once they have done the quick and simple task of signing up for their
user login name. Films will thus be represented with equal opportunities hence
Blockbusters, Soap Operas, and a college thesis film will each have their own
place on omdb.

away from commercial related information with an objective to provide a
self-contained film database.
